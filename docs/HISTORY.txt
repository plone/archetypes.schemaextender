    (name of developer listed in brackets)

archetypes.schemaextender - 1.0a2

    - Schema modifiers implementing ISchemaModifier are now responsible for
      copying fields they modify. See README and the doc strings.
      [fschulze]

    - Added a simple benchmark and made some optimizations by avoiding a lot
      of field copying.
      [fschulze, wiggy]

    - Use a marker interface instead of overrides.zcml - this means you don't
      need to muck with overrides in dependent products.
      [optilude]

    - Added code to allow addition of new schemata. We need an ordered
      dictionary to not bork the order of the schemata.
      [yenzenz]

archetypes.schemaextender - 1.0a1

    - Initial package structure.

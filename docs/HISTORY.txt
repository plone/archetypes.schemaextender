Changelog
=========

svn/unreleased
--------------

* Added optional plone.browserlayer support. Extenders implementing
  IBrowserLayerAwareExtender need to have a layer attribute. Those
  extenders are taken into account only if the specified layer is
  active.

1.0b1 - December 7, 2007
------------------------

* Schema modifiers implementing ISchemaModifier are now responsible for
  copying fields they modify. See README and the doc strings.
  [fschulze]

* Added a simple benchmark and made some optimizations by avoiding a lot
  of field copying.
  [fschulze, wiggy]

* Use a marker interface instead of overrides.zcml - this means you don't
  need to muck with overrides in dependent products.
  [optilude]

* Added code to allow addition of new schemata. We need an ordered
  dictionary to not bork the order of the schemata.
  [jensens]

* Add a small benchmark utility.
  [wichert]

* Replace the high-level test with unit-tests and extend the test coverage.
  [wichert]

* Rewrite the README to be more human readable.

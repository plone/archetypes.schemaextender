Installation
============

Installing without buildout
---------------------------

You can install archetypes.schemaextender in either the system python path
or in the lib/python directory of your Zope instance. If you have setuptools
installed you can do this using easy_install::

  easy_install archetypes.schemaextender

If you do not have setuptools you can install it manually using the setup.py
script in the package source. If you want to install inside your Zope
instance instead of system wide you can its ''--prefix='' option to install
in the ''lib/python'' directory of your Zope instance.

After installing the package it needs to be registered in your Zope
instance.  This can be done by putting a
archetypes.schemaextender-configure.zcml file in the etc/package-includes
directory with this content::

  <include package="archetypes.schemaextender" />

or, alternatively, you can add that line to the configure.zcml in a
package or Product that is already registered.

Installing with buildout
------------------------

If you are using `buildout`_ to manage your instance installing
archetypes.schemaextender is even simpler. You can install it by adding
it to the eggs line for your instance::

  [instance]
  eggs = archetypes.schemaextender
  zcml = archetypes.schemaextender

The last line tells buildout to generate a zcml snippet that tells Zope
to configure archetypes.schemaextender.

If another package depends on the archetypes.schemaextender egg or includes
its zcml directly you do not need to specify anything in the buildout
configuration: buildout will detect this automatically.

After updating the configuration you need to run the ''bin/buildout'', which
will take care of updating your system.

Changelog
=========

2.0 - 2010-05-23
----------------

* Removed the ``caching.zcml`` and enabled caching by default. You can use
  a different caching implementation by using an ``overrides.zcml`` file.
  [hannosch]

* Added ``z3c.autoinclude`` entry point to mark this as a Plone plugin.
  [hannosch]

1.6 - 2010-03-22
----------------

* Fix index accessor to support setting custom accessor methods.
  [witsch]

1.5 - 2009-11-18
----------------

* Fixed test failure in usage.txt.
  [hannosch]

* Standardized package metadata layout.
  [hannosch]

1.4 - 2009-11-05
----------------

* Fix schema copying to also include properties and layers.
  [maerteijn]

1.3 - 2009-10-20
----------------

* Refactored the TranslatableExtensionField getMutator to directly reuse the
  generatedMutatorWrapper from LinguaPlone itself. This avoids duplicating the
  logic and lets schemaextender fields use the special reference field
  handling introduced in LinguaPlone. This change introduces a version
  requirement for LinguaPlone of at least 3.0b6.
  [hannosch]

1.2 - 2009-10-10
----------------

* Add `ISchema` adapter using simple caching on the request in order to
  avoid redundant calculation of the (extended) schema.  The adapter is
  not enabled by default and can be activated by loading `caching.zcml`.
  [witsch]

* Avoid using the overridden `+` operator when copying the original schema
  as this will needlessly validate all fields again.
  [witsch]

* Added missing changelog entry.
  [hannosch, woutervh]

1.1 - 2009-06-03
----------------

* Added support for LinguaPlone language independent fields, by seamlessly
  using a new TranslatableExtensionField when LP is installed.
  [hannosch]

* Added a proper interface to the IExtensionField.
  [hannosch]

* Adjusted tests for Plone 3.3.
  [hannosch]

* Minor adjustment in documentation: a) don't adapt the class in the example,
  b) explain why named adapters are used.
  [jensens]

* Schema modifiers now also browserlayer-aware.
  [jessesnyder]

1.0 - 2008-07-17
----------------

* No changes since 1.0rc1.

1.0rc1 - 2008-04-07
-------------------

* Added optional plone.browserlayer support. Extenders implementing
  IBrowserLayerAwareExtender need to have a layer attribute. Those extenders
  are taken into account only if the specified layer is active.
  [jensens]

1.0b1 - 2007-12-07
------------------

* Schema modifiers implementing ISchemaModifier are now responsible for
  copying fields they modify. See README and the doc strings.
  [fschulze]

* Added a simple benchmark and made some optimizations by avoiding a lot
  of field copying.
  [fschulze, wiggy]

* Use a marker interface instead of overrides.zcml - this means you don't
  need to muck with overrides in dependent products.
  [optilude]

* Added code to allow addition of new schemata. We need an ordered
  dictionary to not bork the order of the schemata.
  [jensens]

* Add a small benchmark utility.
  [wichert]

* Replace the high-level test with unit-tests and extend the test coverage.
  [wichert]

* Rewrite the README to be more human readable.
  [wichert]


1.0a1 - 2007-10-15
------------------

* First public release.
